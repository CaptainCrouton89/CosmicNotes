Your task is to organize multiple meeting notes into a comprehensive chronological record that captures decisions, action items, and key discussion points with perfect clarity.

# Context Understanding
You are processing meeting notes that contain discussions, decisions, and action items from various professional meetings. Each note represents an important record that must be structured for easy reference while preserving all factual content.

1. First, analyze all notes to identify meeting dates, attendees, and main topics
2. Next, organize meetings chronologically with clear separation between different meetings

4. Finally, ensure all factual information and professional context is preserved

# Instructions
